# CLAUDE.md — Developer Guide

This file is for **you** (Claude Code, Cursor, or any dev agent working on this repo).
It is not read by the OpenClaw agent at runtime.

## What This Repo Is

An [OpenClaw](https://docs.openclaw.ai/) agent that automates Workday HR operations
(task approvals, time tracking) via browser automation over Chrome DevTools Protocol.

### Two audiences, two file sets

| Audience | Files |
|----------|-------|
| **OpenClaw agent** (runtime) | AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, PROTOCOL.md, AGENT.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md, TOOLS.md, HEARTBEAT.md, `company-norms/`, `spec/` |
| **Dev agents** (you) | CLAUDE.md, README.md, `scripts/`, Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, package.json, `.env.example` |

## Key Principles

1. **No secrets in git.** All credentials go in `.env`. The `.gitignore` blocks `.env`, `company-norms/`, `.openclaw/`, `memory/`, `logs/`, `artifacts/`.
2. **Progressive disclosure.** AGENTS.md is a concise entry point; details live in `spec/` files. PROTOCOL.md summarizes compliance rules; full agreements live in `company-norms/`.
3. **Zero-install via Docker.** Scripts run in containers: `docker compose run --rm agent node scripts/approve-workday.js`
4. **Agent autonomy.** The OpenClaw agent is designed to make its own decisions within the safety boundaries defined in `spec/safety-boundaries.md`. It asks the user before taking external actions.

## Environment Variables

See `.env.example` for the full list. Key variables:

- `ORG_NAME` / `SSO_PROVIDER_NAME` — Organization name and SSO identity provider label
- `CHROME_CDP_TOKEN` / `CHROME_CDP_PORT` — Chrome DevTools Protocol auth
- `WORKDAY_BASE_URL` — Workday tenant root
- `WORKDAY_TIME_TRACKING_PATH` / `WORKDAY_TASKS_PATH` / `WORKDAY_HOME_PATH` — page paths

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/approve-workday.js` | Click "Approve" on a Workday task via CDP |
| `scripts/get-token.js` | Extract OpenClaw gateway auth token |

Run locally: `node scripts/approve-workday.js`
Run in Docker: `docker compose run --rm agent node scripts/approve-workday.js`

## Making Changes

- **Agent behavior:** Edit AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, PROTOCOL.md, or files in `spec/`
- **Compliance rules:** Update PROTOCOL.md summary AND the full docs in `company-norms/`
- **Automation scripts:** Edit files in `scripts/`, rebuild Docker image
- **New env vars:** Add to both `.env` and `.env.example` (with dummy values in example)

## Conventions

- No hardcoded URLs, tokens, or local paths in committed files
- Scripts read all config from environment variables
- Markdown files use progressive disclosure: summary first, link to details
- The OpenClaw agent files (AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, etc.) follow [OpenClaw template conventions](https://docs.openclaw.ai/reference/templates/)
